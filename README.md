# The Embryo Digital Atlas

The Embryo Digital Atlas is a web based platform for curious citizens, students and scientists, to visualize complex experimental datasets of embryogenesis in an easy and beautiful way.

## Using The Embryo Digital Atlas

We foresee the following uses of our platform:

- Exploring complex datasets by varying time steps, changing modalities and colors, changing datasets, model organisms (fly, zebrafish, human embryos)

- Sharing knowledge about datasets and teaching each other by tagging images.

- Generating beautiful visualizations and exporting for publications or presentations.
