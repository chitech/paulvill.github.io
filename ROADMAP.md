The goal of the Embryo Digital Atlas is to develop a web based platform to visualize complex experimental datasets of embryogenesis in an easy and beautiful way.

The roadmap is still under construction.

The first step will be to develop a fully interactive visualization plaform for the exploration of an experimental data set obtained in Shvartsman Lab at Princeton.
