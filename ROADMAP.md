The goal of the Embryo Digital Atlas is to develop a web based platform to visualize complex experimental datasets of embryogenesis in an easy and beautiful way.

The first step will be to develop a fully interactive visualization plaform for the exploration of an experimental data set obtained in Shvartsman Lab at Princeton.

1. Develop the various features of the interactivity

Dataset:

    - Read in the number of images in the images folder
    - Enable the user to upload its own images
    Longer term
    - 3D datasets, what file format?

Interaction:

    - Mouse interactivity to drag and drop the cube
    Longer term
    - Tactile interactivity?


2. Develop the various features of the visualization

Choice of colors:

    - find a good set of colors automatically
    - find a good way of visualizing the superimposition of colors
